# TinderDog

This repo contains the files for a project that is part of the Udemy course:
> The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp
by Angela Yu

TinderDog is a mock-up for a single-page responsive app for a dog matching service website which uses advanced HTML and CSS for it's development. It was designed by Angela Yu for the purpose of concentrating on the use of Bootstrap 4.5 in positioning sections and elements on a page.  

In addition to the course material I used the following in my development process:

- Awesome Icons for icons
- Gimp 2.10 for image importing/manipulation
- Codeply for testing flexbox layouts and various other idea
